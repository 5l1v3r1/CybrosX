### The problem
Replace this text with a clear statement of a problem including any relevant supporting files ([e.g.](https://github.com/crowdresearch/daemo/issues/1017)). If its a software abnormality, explain how it should act, how it does act, and how to reproduce it.

### The proposal
Replace this text with a clear statement the proposed approach including any relevant supporting files ([e.g.](https://github.com/crowdresearch/daemo/issues/1017)).

It can strengthen your proposal to include *pros* and *cons* and your thoughts about the *implications* (short and long term) of it being executed.

**Note:** if this is a bug, not a `proposal`, then simply complete the `problem` section and remove the rest of the template.
